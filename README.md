# ShopifyPlayStation

This was a Codecademy project called jammming.  I had to build a react app that connects to Spotify's API and allows a user to create a playlist.  I also changed a few things; such as: rendering in React18, changing the name, changing the design to be my own site, and privatizing my Spotify client id with dotenv. and Node. 

The site is deployed [here](https://shopify_play_station.surge.sh/), however if you want to use it you must have a Spotify account and also contact me so I can add your email to the backend.
